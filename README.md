PHP Loops practice to solve the Sissa problem (with french comments).


# What's the problem ?

According to an Indian legend, the game of chess was invented by an old wise man called Sissa. Impressed, his Lord wanted to reward him by granting him a wish. Humblely, Sissa asked for rice, specifying:
'Enough to put 1 grain of rice on the first square of my chessboard, then 2 on the second square, 4 on the third, 8 on the next one, and so on for the 64 squares of the chessboard.'
The Lord agreed to his request. 

This program calculates the total amount of rice that the Lord owes Sissa, first in terms of grains, and then in weight (kilograms and... tons!), knowing that one kilogram of rice consists of 3500 grains.
